              This recipe was adapted from the cookbook
              <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Pan-Pizza-Sicilian-Focaccia/dp/0399581952/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=perfect+pan+pizza+by+peter+reinhart&qid=1592871709&sr=8-1" target="_blank">"Perfect Pan Pizza"</a>
               by Peter Reinhart to fit an 11 inch cast iron skillet used in this video; I think it will also fit into a 9" x 13" pan or something similar in area.

              <br></br>
              <b>INGREDIENTS</b>
              <ul>
                <li> 300 grams all purpose flour (2 ½ cups) </li>
                <li> 236 grams water (1 cup or 8 fluid ounces) (78% hydration) </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon active yeast </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon table salt (or 1 ½ teaspoon Kosher salt) </li>
                <li> Olive Oil, dried herbal seasonings, and grated cheese </li>
              </ul>

              In a mixing bowl combine dry ingredients with spoon or by hand.
              Incorporate water slowly until a sticky dough forms (30-60 seconds of mixing).
              Let dough rest for 5 minutes before beginning the Stretch and Fold Process.  The dough will be very tacky.

              <br></br>
              <b>INSTRUCTIONS</b><br></br>
              <u>STRETCH AND FOLD PROCESS</u></br>
              After the resting the dough, pick it up and stretch and fold the dough like a business letter.
              Rotate it 90 degrees and stretch and fold again, then flip it over and return it to bowl and let it rest covered for five minutes.
              Repeat this process three more times.
              <br></br>
              Stretching and folding is a necessary step because it gives the dough strength and structure to keep the gas bubbles from escaping the dough.
              On the final Stretch and Fold, transfer the dough to a lightly oiled container, cover and refrigerate 12-72 hours for bulk fermentation.

              <br></br>
              <u>SHAPING AND PROOFING</u></br>
              The next day, take the dough out of the refrigerator 3-5 hours before you plan to bake the focaccia and place it into generously oiled 9” x 13” pan, an 11” cast iron skillet, or the like.
              Gently dimple and stretch the dough to conform to the shape of the pan.  If the dough does not reach the edges, rest it covered for 10-15 minutes and try again.

              <br></br>
              Top the dough with more olive oil and dried herbs (press lightly into the dough so they don’t burn in baking).
              Cover the pan to begin the proofing process.

              <br></br>
              At room temperature, dough should be proofed anywhere between 2-4 hours. Longer proofing times also yield a lighter focaccia.
              Because of the short bulk fermentation used in this recipe, the chances of over proofing this dough are limited.
              I find proofing for 2-3 hours to be adequate, but the consistency of the dough is a personal choice. Experiment.

              <br></br>
              Also consider that the optimal proofing temperature range is 75-80° F and that proofing time and temperature are inversely related.

              <br></br>
              <u>BAKE</u></br>
              Preheat the oven to 450° F 30 minutes prior to baking.
              Add any final toppings (cheese, chopped nuts, carmelized onions, etc.) to focaccia.
              <br></br>
              Bake focaccia for 18-22 minutes or until the top is golden and the bottom of the crust is browned.
              <br></br>
              Remove the focaccia from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for about 5 minutes before cutting.
